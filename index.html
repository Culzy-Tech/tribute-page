            <div>I will dearly miss Steve Jobs he inspired me to keep getting the iphones i nave loved them ever since
                the
                first one. Steve Jobs was a great man and a awesome CEO for APPLE. He has inspired me to one day and go
                for
                and work with the apple when i get old but my dream is to own Apple and follow by Steve Jobs way and
                make
                Apple greater than before it was. But i will dearly miss Steve Jobs he's a great man and I will never
                forget
                him.

            <h3>so sad</h3>
            <div>As I heard this sad news via my iPhone I am emailing my condolences from my MacBook Pro. Steve has left
                a
                fingerprint on our culture that cannot be nvaled and will be long lasting. My deepest sympathy to his
                family
                and
                friends

            <h3>Steve Jobs</h3>
            <div>What impact has Steve Jobs had on my life? Every short story I've written as an adult (and certainly
                every
                one that has been published), almost every email I've ever written, has written on machines created by
                Apple. I interacted online an Appe machine long before i ever encountered a PC. Steve Jobs helped to
                realize
                the Star Trek future I dreamed of as a kid. And through his vision, I have been able to realize my own.
                You'll be missed, Mr. Jobs. Thanks for all your amazing work.

            <h3>He's gone...</h3>
            <div>A part of my heart has cracked. I didn't know him personally but I felt like I knew him. I will forever
                remember him. I'm still saddned because he was taken too soon. I can only imagine his struggles. Heaven
                has
                certainly gained an angel.

            <h3>Condolence</h3>
            <div>Dear Apple I was deeply saddened to hear about the death of Steve Jobs, the great leader and creator in
                the
                world. I believe he would go to a more beautiful place and he would like to see a stronger Apple. We
                will
                remember him forever.

            <div>Dear Steve's family, dear Apple company I can't find words how to deschbe my feelings... For me Apple
                means
                a lot - I got a good job using Apple products, I have found a new lifestyle thanks to Apple. And, of
                course,
                I've been always admiring your products. And for me everything in Apple is connected with Steve. I do

                him
                well. As a sign of respect for Steve, I will be turning my IPhone, IPod, and IPad off for one hour, May
                Steve rest in peace
